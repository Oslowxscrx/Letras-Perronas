                    <p>I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
                        The start of nothin'
                        I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
                        The start of nothin'
                        Ooh, I could hate you now
                        It's quite alright to hate me now
                        When we both know that deep down
                        The feeling still deep down is good
                        If I could see through walls
                        I could see you're faking
                        If you could see my thoughts
                        You would see our faces
                        Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
                        We didn't give a fuck back then
                        I ain't a kid no more
                        We'll never be those kids again
                        We'd drive to Syd's, had the back then
                        Back then
                        No matter what I did
                        My waves wouldn't dip back then
                        Everything sucked back then
                        We were friends
                        I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you loved me
                        The start of nothin'
                        I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'

                        It's quite alright to hate me now
                        But we both know that deep down
                        The feeling still deep down is good
                        In the halls of your hotel
                        Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
                        How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
                        We had time to kill back then
                        You ain't a kid no more
                        We'll never be those kids again
                        It's not the same, ivory's illegal
                        Don't you remember?
                        I broke your heart last week
                        You'll probably feel better by the weekend
                        Still remember, had you going crazy
                        Screamin' my name
                        The feeling deep down is good

                        I had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'
                        And we started from nothin'
                        Ooh, I could hate you now
                        It's alright to hate me now
                        We both know that deep down
                        The feeling still deep down is good
                        All the things I didn't mean to say
                        I didn't mean to do
                        There were things you didn't need to say
                        Did you mean to? Mean to?
                        I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
                        I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
                        I've been dreamin', dreamin'</p>

                        Hummingbird, summer sun, has it brought my life back?
                        Hangin' in the balance, have you brought the light back?
                        And how long's the night shift? She's sure I get away with
                        Realizin' she might be all I need in this life
                        When I saw a cold snap, I wasn't with the season
                        Attack was on the airport and outside there was a season

                        Light band all the feelings, I text them for no reason
                        I added love 'cause love is unconditional

                        That mean somebody's gettin' killed"
                        Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
                        All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
                        I wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
                        I'll catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
                        I'll chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
                        Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch I did that"
                        Ain't no black power when your baby killed by a coward
                        I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
                        It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
                        Ghetto bird on the street, paramedics on the dial
                        Let somebody touch my momma
                        Touch my sister, touch my woman
                        Touch my daddy, touch my niece
                        Touch my nephew, touch my brother
                        You should chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
                        Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
                        Call you back
                        Alright kids we're gonna talk about gun control
                        (Pray for me) Damn
                        It's not a place
                        This country is to be a sound of drum and bass
                        You close your eyes to look around
                        Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
                        The great American flag
                        Is wrapped and dragged with explosives
                        Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
                        Barricaded blocks and borders
                        Look what you taught us
                        It's murder on my street, your street, back streets
                        Wall street, corporate offices, banks
                        Employees and bosses with homicidal thoughts
                        Donald Trump's in office, we lost Barack
                        And promised to never doubt him again
                        But is America honest or do we bask in sin?
                        Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
                        Then bash him in, you crippin' or you married to blood?
                        I'll ask again—oops—accident
                        It's nasty when you set us up
                        Then roll the dice, then bet us up
                        You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
                        Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
                        Americas reflections of me
                        That's what a mirror does
                        It's not a place
                        This country is to be a sound of drum and bass
                        You close your eyes to look ar—</p>

                    <p>I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
                        The start of nothin'
                        I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
                        The start of nothin'
                        Ooh, I could hate you now
                        It's quite alright to hate me now
                        When we both know that deep down
                        The feeling still deep down is good
                        If I could see through walls
                        I could see you're faking
                        If you could see my thoughts
                        You would see our faces
                        Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
                        We didn't give a fuck back then
                        I ain't a kid no more
                        We'll never be those kids again
                        We'd drive to Syd's, had the back then
                        Back then
                        No matter what I did
                        My waves wouldn't dip back then
                        Everything sucked back then
                        We were friends
                        I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you loved me
                        The start of nothin'
                        I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
                        The start of nothin'
                        Ooh, I could hate you now
                        It's quite alright to hate me now
                        But we both know that deep down
                        The feeling still deep down is good
                        In the halls of your hotel
                        Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
                        How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
                        We had time to kill back then
                        You ain't a kid no more
                        We'll never be those kids again
                        It's not the same, ivory's illegal
                        Don't you remember?
                        I broke your heart last week
                        You'll probably feel better by the weekend
                        Still remember, had you going crazy
                        Screamin' my name
                        The feeling deep down is good
                        I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you loved me
                        The start of nothin'
                        I had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'
                        And we started from nothin'
                        Ooh, I could hate you now
                        It's alright to hate me now
                        We both know that deep down
                        The feeling still deep down is good
                        All the things I didn't mean to say
                        I didn't mean to do
                        There were things you didn't need to say
                        Did you mean to? Mean to?
                        I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
                        I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
                        I've been dreamin', dreamin'</p>
